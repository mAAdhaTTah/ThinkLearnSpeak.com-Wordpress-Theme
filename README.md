# WordPress Theme for [Think. Learn. Speak.](http://www.thinklearnspeak.com "Think. Learn. Speak.") #

This is the current theme for the WordPress blog hosted at ThinkLearnSpeak.com.

See something you like to change, fix, or update? Please fork this theme and send me a pull request!

A few things to note:

1. This is a child theme based on Wordpress 3.6's twentythirteen. Currently, that version is still in beta, so you'll need to update to a development version to use this. All caveats regarding development versions apply!
2. The homepage requires MetaSlider - the theme currently has an id tied to my particular install. If you want to use this theme for your site, you'll have to substitute the id for your own.
3. The subscribe.php file is based on widgets, so you also manage that in the database.
